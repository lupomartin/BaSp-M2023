```
They asked us to develop a page for a gym with different membership options, hours and activities to practice.
```
## Week 01
We made a figma dividing the tasks into 6 groups, making the following requests:

```
- Members
- Admin
- Super-Admin
- Langing
- Sign-In
- Schedules

```
## Week 02
What we did this week was convert what the landing group did to html code.
What we will be able to see would be the main page where we have characteristics, membership options and data about the gym

## Week 03
This week what we did was apply styles to our html so that it looked the same as the landing.

## Week 04
This week we made a responsive design using flexbox and following breakpoints:
```
from a minimum of 390px to 600px, mobile
from 601px to 1024px, tablet
from there, desktop
```
