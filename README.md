```
They asked us to develop a page for a gym with different membership options, hours and activities to practice.
```
## Week 01
We made a figma dividing the tasks into 6 groups, making the following requests:

```
- Members
- Admin
- Super-Admin
- Langing
- Sign-In
- Schedules

```
## Week 02
What we did this week was convert what the landing group did to html code.
What we will be able to see would be the main page where we have characteristics, membership options and data about the gym
